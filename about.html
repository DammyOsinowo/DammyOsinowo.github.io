            <p style="text-align:center"> Hi, I'm <span style="color:skyblue">Dammy Osinowo</span> and I am a junior at The University of Oklahoma studying Management Information Systems. </p>
            <p style="text-align:center">My interest in IT began in high school when I discovered that I had a deep Interest for information systems and business. I took a wide range of classes in high school from subjects like Accounting, Business, Geography to Information system Technology (ICT). My most interesting class was my ICT class because that was the first class that I was introduced to how technology is used in society and work environments. I also discovered that I was proficient in concepts like Data Analysis and web authoring and decided that pursuing a career in that field would be my best option. So when I found out about MIS I knew it was the right major for me.  </p>
            <p style="text-align:center"> During my three years in OU so far, I have been involved in student organizations like the MIS Student Association and the African Student Association. My involvement & leadership experiences in these student organizations have prepared me to work with people as a leader, contributor, and strong team member. 
                Currently, I am seeking an internship this summer to gain professional experience in IT. Feel free to download my resume <a href="https://sooners-my.sharepoint.com/personal/osinowodammy_ou_edu/Documents/new%20resume%20spring%20for%20website.pdf "> HERE</a> After graduation, I plan to eventually work towards a master of Management Information Technology with a focus on Business Analytics. </p>
            <p  style="text-align:center"> Outside of academics I enjoy cooking, watching tv shows, taking walks & making promotional flyers. </p>
